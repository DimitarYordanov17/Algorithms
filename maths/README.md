## 1. Taylor Series

We can approximate a function by another function in a polynomial form. There is a certain way to do that and it is called
Taylor series. You can approximate a function by a polynomial in the form of Taylor series. For that we just need
the function to be differentiable at a certain interval.

The main formula for calculating the Taylor series representation of a given function:

whereas x0 is the center of approximation and f`n(x) are the derivatives of the original function
