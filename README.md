# Algorithms
### Several algorithms implemented in Python, documented and classified by different categories.
#### (Feel free to contribute to the project)

At the end of every algorithm, there is driver (example) code to demonstrate the algorithm

1. Artificial intelligence

      - MiniMax (TicTacToe) (Cannot be considered as an exact A.I. algorithm, more of a Maths one)
      
            Dependencies: tictactoeaddons.py, copy, inspect


2. Compression

      - Huffman compression (coding)

            Dependencies: No dependencies

      - Run-length compression (encoding) 

            Dependencies: re (Regex)

3. Cryptography 

      - Advanced Encryption Standard (Rijndael)

            Dependencies: copy

      - Diffie-Hellman key exchange

            Dependencies: math, time, random
            
      - Message Digest 5 (MD5)
      
            Dependencies: math, numpy, random

4. Data science

      - Principal Component Analysis (2D)

            Dependencies: random, numpy, sympy, matplotlib.pyplot, math

      - Cluster Analysis (K-means and Hierarchial clustering)

            Dependencies: numpy, matplotlib.pyplot

5. Drawing (Fractals)

        Dependencies: turtle

      - Fractal Tree
      - Koch Snowflake

6. Graphics

      - Value Noise

            Dependencies: random, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, matplotlib.image
7. Maths

      - Taylor series
      
            Dependencies: sympy, math

8. Sorting

        Dependencies: unittest (just for the tests)

      - Insertion Sort
      - Merge sort
